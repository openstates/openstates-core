 7   the Reserve until funds are needed to comply with the allocations as set forth in this act. Funds

13   purpose of the Fund is to provide necessary and appropriate relief and assistance from the effects
14   of Hurricane Florence, consistent with the provisions of this act,act and with subsequent

27   by this section and allocated in this act ratifies the prior budgetary action taken by the Governor
28   and shall not be construed to duplicate that transfer of lottery funds.

17   REIMBURSEMENT FOR FUNDS PROVIDED UNDER THIS ACT
18                SECTION 4.2.(a) A recipient of State funds under this act shall use best efforts and
19   take all reasonable steps to obtain alternative funds that cover the losses or needs for which the
20   State funds are provided, including funds from insurance policies in effect and available federal
21   aid. State funds paid under this act are declared to be excess over funds received by a recipient
22   from the settlement of a claim for loss or damage covered under the recipient's applicable
23   insurance policy in effect. Further, each institution of higher education and non-State entity that
24   receives State funds under this act shall also seek private donations to help cover the losses or
25   needs for which these State funds are provided.
26                SECTION 4.2.(b) If a recipient obtains alternative funds pursuant to subsection (a)
27   of this section, the recipient shall remit the funds to the State agency from which the State funds
28   were received. A recipient is not required to remit any amount in excess of the State funds
29   provided to the recipient under this act. The State agency shall transfer these funds to the
30   Hurricane Florence Disaster Recovery Fund. The funds shall further be transferred to the
31   applicable fund or reserve from which the funds were originally transferred to the Fund, except
32   that the first twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) deposited under this subsection as
33   reimbursement for funds expended for repair and renovation of facilities damaged by Hurricane
34   Florence for local school administrative units, lab schools, and any eligible Innovative School
35   District shall be transferred to the Education Lottery Reserve Fund. Funds deposited into the
36   Fund under this subsection are receipts that do not constitute an "appropriation made by law," as
37   that phrase is used in Section 7(1) of Article V of the North Carolina Constitution.
38                SECTION 4.2.(c) Any contract or other instrument entered into by a recipient for
39   receipt of funds under this act shall include the requirements set forth in subsections (a) and (b)
40   of this section.
41                SECTION 4.2.(d) For purposes of this section, the term "recipient" means a local
42   political subdivision of the State, a State agency, a State department, an institution of higher
43   education as defined in Section 5.3(a) of this act, a public school unit as defined in Section 5.1
44   of this act, or a non-State entity.
45
46   ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON USE OF FUNDS
47               SECTION 4.3.(a) The Governor shall ensure that funds appropriated in this act are
48   expended in a manner that does not adversely affect any person's or entity's eligibility for federal
49   funds that are made available, or that are anticipated to be made available, as a result of Hurricane
50   Florence. The Governor shall also, to the extent practicable, avoid using State funds to cover
51   costs that will be, or likely will be, covered by federal funds.

10   the 2018-2019 fiscal year, the State Board of Education shall adjust the allotted average daily
11   membership (ADM) of public school units for the 2018-2019 school year in a manner that will
12   assist units impacted by Hurricane Florence as follows: Allotment adjustments for ADM
13   decreases shall be based on the highest of the first four months' ADM for public school units
14   located in counties designated under a major disaster declaration by the President of the United
15   States under the Stafford Act (P.L. 93-288) as a result of Hurricane Florence.
16               Consistent with the Allotment Adjustments for ADM Growth provisions of the NC
17   Public Schools Allotment Policy Manual applicable for the 2018-2019 school year, local school
18   administrative units are encouraged to apply for additional funding to address needs related to
19   extraordinary ADM growth due to an influx of displaced students as a result of Hurricane
20   Florence.
21               If the State Board of Education does not have sufficient resources in the ADM
22   Contingency Reserve line item to make allotment adjustments in accordance with this section,
23   the State Board of Education may use funds appropriated to State Aid for Public Schools for this
24   purpose.
25               For the purposes of this section, "public school unit" is defined as a local school
26   administrative unit, regional school, innovative school, laboratory school, charter school, or

38   damage and destruction from Hurricane Florence. An emergency scholarship grant shall be used
39   to mitigate the impact of Hurricane Florence on a student so that his or her postsecondary
40   education in a North Carolina institution of higher education continues uninterrupted. These
41   funds may be used to cover any expenses that support a student's continued enrollment, including
42   costs related to transportation, textbooks, tuition, fees, and living expenses.

44   constituent institution of The University of North Carolina, a community college under the
45   jurisdiction of the State Board of Community Colleges, or an eligible private postsecondary
46   institution, as defined in G.S. 116-280(3).

48   of higher education that is eligible for an allocation of funds pursuant to this section shall begin

 3                (2)    The student has a financial need related to the impact of Hurricane Florence.

10                                permanently, in a county designated under a major disaster declaration
11                                by the President of the United States under the Stafford Act (P.L.

22   in the order in which applications are received. If the institution of higher education has
23   unexpended funds remaining after the award of the initial emergency scholarship grants, the
24   institution may increase the award to an eligible postsecondary student who previously received
25   funds or solicit additional applications from eligible postsecondary students, provided that the
26   award to an individual student does not exceed one thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($1,250)

29   postsecondary student who receives an emergency scholarship grant under the Program shall use
30   best efforts and take all reasonable steps to obtain alternative funds that cover the losses or needs
31   for which the emergency scholarship grant funds are provided, including funds from insurance
32   policies in effect and available federal aid. If the student obtains alternative funds, the student
33   shall remit the amount of the emergency scholarship grant covered by the alternative funds to the
34   institution of higher education. A student is not required to remit any amount in excess of the
35   funds provided to the student.
36                SECTION 5.3.(e) Funds for UNC Constituent Institutions. – Of the funds allocated
37   to the Board of Governors of The University of North Carolina from the Hurricane Florence
38   Disaster Recovery Fund for the 2018-2019 fiscal year, the sum of two million dollars
39   ($2,000,000) in nonrecurring funds shall be allocated by the Board of Governors to constituent

19   HURRICANE FLORENCE AGRICULTURAL DISASTER PROGRAM OF 2018
20          SECTION 5.11.(a) The General Assembly finds that:
21          (1)  The historic flood and other impacts of Hurricane Florence in September of
22               2018 caused unprecedented damage to the State and its people, with particular
23               devastating statewide impacts on North Carolina farmers and the State's
24               agriculture industry.
25          (2)  The State has over 50,000 farms across over 8 million acres, which generates
26               87 billion dollars of economic impact annually and represents the State's
27               number one industry, making it a vital component to a healthy state economy.
28          (3)  The total loss of crops as a result of the flooding is estimated at over a billion
29               dollars and the estimated federal crop insurance payments will only cover a
30               percentage of the total crop loss.
31          (4)  The federal crop insurance program as authorized in the 2014 Farm Bill is an
32               inadequate method of indemnification as compared to traditional forms of
33               insurance and is not sufficient to aid farmers with substantial losses due to
34               catastrophic events of nature.
35          (5)  The State has a significant public interest to prevent the economic collapse of
36               many of the State's farms, which could cause a severe disruption in the State's
37               economy and food supply chain.
38          (6)  The most effective program for administration of financial assistance is
39               two-fold. The first category shall be based on information available from the
40               Farm Service Agency ("FSA") within the United States Department of
41               Agriculture ("USDA"). The second category, for producers who do not
42               participate in FSA programs, shall be based on verifiable documentation from
43               producers.
44          SECTION 5.11.(b) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:
45          (1)  Agricultural commodity. – Apples, barley, corn, cotton, dry peas, flax, forage,
46               freezing and canning peas, grain sorghum, grapes, hay, industrial hemp, native
47               grass, nursery crops, nuts, oats, peanuts, potatoes, rye, soybeans, sunflowers,
48               sweet corn, tobacco, tomatoes, wheat, specialty crops and other fruits and
49               vegetables, and aquacultural species propagated or reared in a controlled or
50               selected environment. An agricultural commodity does not include stored
51               grain.
