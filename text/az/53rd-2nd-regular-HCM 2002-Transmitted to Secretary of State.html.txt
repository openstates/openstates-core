To the
Congress of the United States of America:

Your
memorialist respectfully represents:

Whereas,
the United States and Mexico are important trade partners, and commerce between
the two countries is a critical source of jobs, income and exchange; and  

Whereas,
according to the United States Department of Commerce, more than $500 billion
in bilateral trade and over $100 billion in cross‑border investment occur
annually; and

Whereas,
in Arizona, $28 billion in two-way trade is processed annually through
Arizona's ports of entry; and

Whereas,
according to the United States Census Bureau, Arizona exports to Mexico totaled
$7.1 billion in 2013; and

Whereas,
the prime conduits for cross-border trade are through the ports of entry in
Nogales, Douglas and San Luis, Arizona; and

Whereas,
the Customs Field Office personnel within the United States Customs and Border
Protection service of the United States Department of Homeland Security serve a
vital function in promoting security and economic stability; and

Whereas,
the lack of capacity and staffing for customs inspections at these primary
entry points creates congestion for incoming and outgoing goods, hampers
commercial activity and potentially compromises border security; and

Whereas,
these impediments ultimately translate into perished agricultural produce and
lost business opportunities and income; and  

Whereas,
the rapid delivery of goods and commerce enhances business activity and
strengthens economic integration; and 

Whereas,
greater inspection capacity at the ports of entry in Nogales, Douglas and San
Luis, Arizona will enhance the safety and swiftness of goods moving across the
border, benefiting the economies of both nations; and

Whereas,
increasing the number of Customs Field Office personnel at these United States
border sites will facilitate commercial traffic and will result in increased
economic growth and stability for Arizona; and

Whereas,
a letter dated October 14, 2014 that was signed by every member of the Arizona
Congressional delegation and sent to the United States Department of Homeland
Security expressed the need for greater staffing and allocation of personnel to
Arizona's ports of entry.

Wherefore your memorialist, the
House of Representatives of the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:

1.  That
the United States Congress act expeditiously to increase and maintain staffing
for qualified and properly vetted Customs Field Office personnel at the ports
of entry in Nogales, Douglas and San Luis, Arizona in order to prudently speed
the flow of goods and commerce.

2.  That
the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial
to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States
House of Representatives and each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona.
