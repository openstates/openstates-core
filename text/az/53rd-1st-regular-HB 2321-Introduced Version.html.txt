Be it
enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:

Section 1.  Section 33-1250, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:

START_STATUTE33-1250.  Voting;
proxies; absentee ballots; cumulative voting; applicability; definition

A.  If
only one of the multiple owners of a unit is present at a meeting of the
association, the owner is entitled to cast all the votes allocated to that
unit.  If more than one of the multiple owners are present, the votes
allocated to that unit may be cast only in accordance with the agreement of a
majority in interest of the multiple owners unless the declaration expressly
provides otherwise.  There is majority agreement if any one of the multiple
owners casts the votes allocated to that unit without protest being made
promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the other owners of
the unit.

B.  During
the period of declarant control, votes allocated to a unit may be cast pursuant
to a proxy duly executed by a unit owner.  If a unit is owned by more than one
person, each owner of the unit may vote or register protest to the casting of
votes by the other owners of the unit through a duly executed proxy.  A unit
owner may not revoke a proxy given pursuant to this section except by actual
notice of revocation to the person presiding over a meeting of the
association.  A proxy is void if it is not dated or purports to be revocable
without notice.  The proxy is revoked on presentation of a later
dated proxy executed by the same unit owner.  A proxy terminates one year after
its date, unless it specifies a shorter term or unless it states that it is
coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.

C.  Notwithstanding
any provision in the condominium documents, after termination of the period of
declarant control, votes allocated to a unit may not be cast pursuant to a
proxy.  The association shall provide for votes to be cast in person
and by absentee ballot and, in addition, the association may provide for voting
by some other form of delivery, including the use of e-mail and fax
delivery.  Notwithstanding section 10‑3708 or the provisions of
the condominium documents, any action taken at an annual, regular or special
meeting of the members shall comply with all of the following if absentee
ballots or ballots provided by some other form of delivery are used:

1.  The
ballot shall set forth each proposed action.

2.  The
ballot shall provide an opportunity to vote for or against each proposed action.

3.  The
ballot is valid for only one specified election or meeting of the members and
expires automatically after the completion of the election or meeting.

4.  The
ballot specifies the time and date by which the ballot must be delivered to the
board of directors in order to be counted, which shall be at least seven days
after the date that the board delivers the unvoted ballot to the member.

5.  The
ballot does not authorize another person to cast votes on behalf of the member.

6.  The
completed ballot and envelope and any related materials shall contain the name,
the address and either the actual or
electronic signature of the person voting, except that if the condominium
documents permit secret ballots, only the envelope or any nonballot‑related
materials shall contain the name, the
address and either the actual or electronic signature of the voter.

7.  Ballots,
envelopes and related materials, including sign-in sheets if used, shall be
retained in electronic or paper format and made available for unit owner
inspection for at least one year after completion of the election.

D.  Votes
cast by absentee ballot or other form of delivery, including the use of e‑mail
and fax delivery, are valid for the purpose of establishing a quorum.

E.  Notwithstanding
subsection C of this section, an association for a timeshare plan as defined in
section 32‑2197 may permit votes by a proxy that is duly executed by a
unit owner.

F.  If
the declaration requires that votes on specified matters affecting the
condominium be cast by lessees rather than unit owners of leased units all of
the following apply:

1.  The
provisions of subsections A and B of this section apply to lessees as if they
were unit owners.

2.  Unit
owners who have leased their units to other persons shall not cast votes on
those specified matters.

3.  Lessees
are entitled to notice of meetings, access to records and other rights
respecting those matters as if they were unit owners.  Unit owners shall also
be given notice, in the manner prescribed in section 33‑1248, of all
meetings at which lessees may be entitled to vote.

G.  Unless
the declaration provides otherwise, votes allocated to a unit owned by the
association shall not be cast.

H.  Notwithstanding
title 10, chapter 30 and any provision in the condominium documents, an
association may not use a process whereby unit owners cumulate their votes by
multiplying the number of votes they are entitled to cast by the number of
directors for whom they are entitled to vote and cast the product for a single candidate
or distribute the product among two or more candidates, otherwise known as
cumulative voting.  this subsection does not prohibit a person who owns more
than one unit from casting a ballot for each unit owned.

H.  I.  This section does not apply to
timeshare plans or associations that are subject to chapter 20 of this title.

I.  J.  For the purposes of this section,
"period of declarant control" means the time during which the
declarant or persons designated by the declarant may elect or appoint the
members of the board of directors pursuant to the condominium documents or by
virtue of superior voting power. END_STATUTE
