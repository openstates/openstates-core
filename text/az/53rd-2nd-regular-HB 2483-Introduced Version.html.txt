Be it
enacted by the Legislature of the State of Arizona:

Section 1.  Section 42-2072, Arizona Revised
Statutes, is amended to read:

START_STATUTE42-2072.  Stay
of enforcement actions pending offer in compromise

A.  A
taxpayer who is unable to pay all of a liability may make an offer in
compromise for abatement of part of the liability on the grounds that the
remainder is uncollectible pursuant to section 42‑1004, subsection B,
paragraph 1.

B.  While
the offer is under consideration by the department and the attorney general,
the department shall not levy on the taxpayer or any holder of the taxpayer's
assets unless the department finds that collection, otherwise possibly possible, would be jeopardized by a
delay.  A taxpayer who is aggrieved by a decision to levy while an
offer in compromise is pending may appeal that decision to the problem
resolution officer, and the decision of the problem resolution officer is final
as to both the department and the taxpayer. END_STATUTE
